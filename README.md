# Windswept
**Made for the GMTK GameJam 2025**
https://skylarkblue1.itch.io/windswept

> Requires Unity 6000.1.13

## PostJam TODO
* **Multiple Portals** - the code should work, you just need a way of specifying which portal is which
* **Boosters** - a speed boost
* **Better Save/Load** - it's very barebones at the moment
* **More Levels**
* **Better Onboarding** - tell people how to play the game
* **In Game Backgrounds**
* **No build areas** - in the editor, you should be able to define Rects where the player can't build
* **Trail tracing**
* **Person Animations**
* **Better Inventory Descriptions** - they're just the enum names right now
* **Removing things in play mode** - you can only undo right now
* **Proper menu** - with Hard Reset and main menu
* **Stop loops overlapping in editor**
* **Don't deselect when using in editor**
